# CMA-Labs
### Codes are a part of the lab course CS5016 (Computational Methods and Applications) done in the 6th semester. 

### Course Objectives:
The main objective of this course is to introduce students to some of the key computational techniques used in modelling and simulation of real-world phenomena. This course is designed to expose students to techniques and methods from a variety of disciplines, not normally encompassed in a single course. Unlike other courses focused more specifically on algorithms, data structures or numerical analysis, this course emphasizes hands-on programming to understand a variety of scientific phenomena and computational methods.
